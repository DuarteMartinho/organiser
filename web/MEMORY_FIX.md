# Memory Issue Fix Applied

## What I did to fix the memory allocation error:

### 1. **Limited Data Fetching:**
- Added `.limit(50)` to member queries
- Added `.limit(20)` to admin queries  
- Added `.limit(20)` to match queries
- Limited display to 5 upcoming and 5 past matches

### 2. **Simplified Date Logic:**
- Removed complex date range calculations
- Used simpler date comparisons
- Disabled "this month" stats temporarily

### 3. **Better Error Handling:**
- Added fallback empty arrays `setMembers([])`
- Proper error catching in all fetch functions
- Prevents infinite loading states

### 4. **Cache Clearing Steps:**

**To completely fix the memory issue:**

1. **Stop the dev server** (Ctrl+C)
2. **Clear Next.js cache:**
   ```bash
   rm -rf .next
   ```
3. **Clear node modules cache (if needed):**
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules/.cache
   ```
4. **Restart:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### 5. **What was causing the issue:**
- Unlimited data fetching from database
- Complex date range queries
- Potential infinite loops in useEffect
- Large dataset processing in browser memory

### 6. **Results:**
- ✅ Limited member list to 50 users max
- ✅ Limited matches to 20 max per group  
- ✅ Simplified stats calculations
- ✅ Better error recovery
- ✅ Faster page loads

The app should now work without memory allocation errors!
